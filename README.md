## How to access

We provided several ways to access our designed shiny-apps, include: 
1.	Github: Apps can be loaded through access by commands: 

    a.	shiny::runGitHub('NISS_Competition_2022', 'xingyanwang-david', subdir = "Table502")
    
    b.	shiny::runGitHub('NISS_Competition_2022', 'xingyanwang-david', subdir = "Table221.60")
2.	Running Locally: Apps can be running locally by unzipping corresponding files and run app.R. 
3.	Access through shinyapp.ios: We published our apps on shinyapp.ios. By clicking links, apps will be loaded on a webpage without downloading any packages dependencies. 

* For approach 1 and 2, in order to successfully run our developed app, some required R packages are needed.
